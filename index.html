	Here at Kangaroo Smiles our goal is to make you and your child feel as comfortable as possible. This is why we’ve created an atmosphere with calm colors, wall murals, interactive areas for kids and a coffee bar to give our parents a little pick-me-up while they’re here.
	
	You will also discover our open-concept exam and treatment area, created to help everyone feel comfortable and safe. Don’t forget our digital x-ray machines, designed to cut your child’s radiation exposure to about 70% less than traditional x-ray machines.
